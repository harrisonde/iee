## Introduction
iee (iframe event emitter) is a framework for sending communication cross-origin. It is designed for projects where granting permission to resources on a different origin may not be possible. The core of the application focuses on simple one-way messaging between privileged and non-privileged pages.

### Compatibility 
iee offers support down to IE8
