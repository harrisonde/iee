## Introduction
Window Rivet is a zero-dependency module for transparent bidirectional communication across origins by fastening separate domains together using the Window object.

## Documentation
### Usage
#### One-way messaging between a privileged and non-privileged domain:

Domain A
```js
    const Rivet = require('@cidekar/rivet')

    // New-up an instance if rivet 
    const rivet = new rivet()
    
    // New-up the dispatcher
    const dispatcher = new rivet.dispatcher();

    // Dispatch single message from domain A.
    dispatcher.message({
        event: 'confirm', 
        message: 'Did you get my message?',
    });
```

Domain B
```js
    const Rivet = require('@cidekar/rivet')

    // New-up an instance if rivet 
    const rivet = new rivet()

    // New-up the receiver
    const receiver = new rivet.receiver();

    // Receive a message on domain B.
    receiver.listen('confirm', function(event){
        //... Handle message 
    });
```

#### Bidirectional messaging between a privileged and non-privileged domain:

Domain A
```js
    const Rivet = require('@cidekar/rivet')

    // New-up an instance if rivet 
    const rivet = new rivet()
    
    // New-up the dispatcher
    const dispatcher = new rivet.dispatcher();

    // Receive a message from domain B.
    dispatcher.listen('response', function (event) {
        //... handle the reply 
    })

    // Dispatch a message from domain A.
    dispatcher.message({
        event: 'confirm', 
        message: 'Did you get my message?',
    });
```

Domain B
```js
    const Rivet = require('@cidekar/rivet')

    // New-up an instance of rivet 
    const rivet = new rivet()

    // New-up the receiver
    const receiver = new rivet.receiver();

    // A Simple reply function
    function reply(response, event) {
        receiver.message(response, event)
    }

    // Receive a message from domain A and reply.
    receiver.listen('confirm', function(event){
        reply({
            event: 'response',
            message: 'Yes. Thank you for asking!',
        })
    });

```
#### What version should a developer use?
Window Rivet is compiled for use in the browser and Node. To find the right version for your use case take a look at the [build files definition table](/dist/).

## API

### Configuration
| Name              | Argument  |  Default    | Description   |                                  
| ----------------- | --------  | ---------- | ------------- |
| Dispatcher Origin | ```dispatcherOrigin``` | ```["*"]```| The origin of Dispatcher component. |
| Receiver Origin   | ```receiverOrigin```   | ```["*"]```| The origin of Receiver component.   |
| Warning Origin    |  ```warningOrigin```   | ```true``` | Display configuration waring in console; top level.  |
| Silent            | ```silent```           | ```false``` | Display all cross-origin communication between Window objects.       |

### Components
| Type           | [Newable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new) | Description |
| -------------  | ------------- | -------- |
| Dispatcher     | X | Create, serialize, and transfer messages. |
| Receiver       | X |Listen, validate, and handel messages. |

### Events
| Type           | Argument   | Description   | 
| -------------  | ---------- | ------------- |
| Message        |  ```{ event: string, message: string, array, or object }``` | Send a message to a component.  |
| Listen         |  ```{ event: string, message: string, array, or object }```    | Listen for a message from a component. |

### Hooks
| Type           | Life Cycle | Description   | 
| -------------  | ------------- | ------------- |
| Created        |  Register and Ready | System startup, prepare to enter, record, and processed a configuration.              |
| Mounted        |  Register and Ready | System has completely processed the configuration and ready for communication.            |
| Dispatcher     |  Boot, Register, and Ready | The dispatcher is booted, registered into the system, and ready for communication.            |
| Receiver     |  Boot, Register, and Ready | The dispatcher is booted, registered into the system, and ready for communication.            |


#### System Life Cycle
- Kernel is loaded executing a thin bootloader layer initializing the system.
- System hooks are created, components set into a ready state, and system is mounted to a domain.
- A new instance of the Dispatcher and Receiver are created returning methods for bidirectional communication bound to each domain Window object.
- A Dispatcher message is serialized and sent to a Receiver.
- The Receiver receives the message and validates the origin and shape. 
- Authorized messages are synchronously dispatched to the Window firing a callback function with the message from the Dispatcher.
- The Receiver sends a reply to the Dispatcher with a serialized message.
